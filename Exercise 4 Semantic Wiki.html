<h1>Counter-Strike Global Offensive</h1>
<h2>Game Play</h2>
<u1>
    <li>
    Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. 
        Two opposing teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to repeatedly complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or capturing hostages.
        At the end of each short round, players are rewarded based on individual and team performance with in-game currency to spend on other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds.
        Winning rounds generally rewards more money than losing does, and completing map-based objectives, including killing enemies, gives additional cash bonuses.

</a>

<h2>Game Modes</h2>
<ul>

    <li>
    Competitive, Casual, Deathmatch, Arms Race, Demolition, Wingman, Flying Scoutsman, Retakes and Danger Zone. 
    The Competitive mode, the primary gameplay experience, pits two teams of five players against each other in a best-of-30 match.
    When playing Competitive, players have a skill rank based on a Glicko rating system and are paired with and against other players around the same ranking.
    The Casual and Deathmatch modes are less serious than Competitive mode and do not register friendly fire.

<h2>Development and Release</h2>
<ul>

    <li>
        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the sequel to the popular first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Source, developed by Valve. 
        Global Offensive's development began when Hidden Path Entertainment attempted to port Counter-Strike: Source onto video game consoles
        The Casual and Deathmatch modes are less serious than Competitive mode and do not register friendly fire.
        On August 21, 2012, the game was publicly released on all platforms except Linux, which would not be released until September 23, 2014.
