                In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Captain Mitch Nelson leads a US Special Forces team into Afghanistan for an extremely dangerous mission. 
                Once there, the soldiers develop an uneasy partnership with the Northern Alliance to take down the Taliban and its al-Qaida allies. Outgunned and outnumbered, 
                Nelson and his forces face overwhelming odds in a fight against a ruthless enemy that takes no prisoners.

                Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, 
                compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's 
                hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing 
                the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop
